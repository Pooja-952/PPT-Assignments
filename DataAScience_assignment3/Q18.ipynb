    "### To perform a simple linear regression to predict sales based on price, we can use the provided data and apply the linear regression analysis. Linear regression helps determine the relationship between two variables and enables us to make predictions based on the values of one variable (independent variable) for a given value of the other variable (dependent variable).\n",
