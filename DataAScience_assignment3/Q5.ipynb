    "### To determine if there is a significant difference in the mean scores between two groups, we can perform an independent t-test. The t-test compares the means of two groups and evaluates whether the difference is statistically significant.\n",

    "standard deviation(Group A) = sqrt(variance(Group A)) = sqrt(5.6) ≈ 2.37\n",
    "standard deviation(Group B) = sqrt(variance(Group B)) = sqrt(3.2) ≈ 1.79\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate the pooled standard deviation.\n",

    "≈ sqrt(22.44 + 12.80) / 8\n",
    "≈ sqrt(35.24) / 8\n",
    "≈ 1.67\n",

    "Step 7: Compare the t-statistic with the critical t-value for the desired significance level and degrees of freedom. Let's assume a significance level of 0.05 (95% confidence).\n",
    "The critical t-value for a two-tailed test with 8 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05 is approximately 2.306.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculated t-statistic (2.48) is greater than the critical t-value (2.306), we can reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is a significant difference in the mean scores between Group A and Group B.\n",

    "In conclusion, based on the t-test, there is evidence to support that there is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two groups, implying that the teaching methods may have had an impact on the students' test performance."
